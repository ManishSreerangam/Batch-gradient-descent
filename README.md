# MachineLearning_LinearRegression (Implementation without any pre-defined libraries)
This task is part of weekly programming task for the subject titled "Machine Learning" 
# Objective : 
Goal of this assignment is  to develop a holistic understanding of linear regression (multiple linear regression) with the help of gradient descent * refer to p_sheet1 for more information about our task
# Programming language 
Python **(without using numpy , pandas , scikit learn)**
# Dataset
* We are provided with 2 datasets titled **random-1** and **random-2**.
* Both of these datasets have 2 independent variables and one dependent variables
# Implementation
* I have used batch gradient descent
